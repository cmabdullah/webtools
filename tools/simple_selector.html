<h1>Simple selectors</h1>
<h2>Sub heading 1</h2>
<p class="highlite">.ClassName: Selects any objects that have a class attribute value with the given name. For example, .StdPara would select every object that has a class=”StdPara” attribute without regard for object type.</p>
<p class="highlite">.ClassName: Selects any objects that have a class attribute value with the given name. For example, .StdPara would select every object that has a class=”StdPara” attribute without regard for object type.</p>

<h2>Sub heading 2</h2>
<p>It’s possible to further restrict many of these attribute selectors by combining them with tag selectors. For example, p[title~=”Secondary”] selects only the <p> tag objects with title attributes that contain the word Secondary as a discrete word. It’s often possible to combine selectors in unique ways to create precisely the effect you want.</p>

<div>#Id: Selects any objects that have an id attribute value with the given name. For example, #ThirdHeader would select every object that has an id=”ThirdHeader” attribute without regard for object type.
<span  id="mainpoint">id="mainPoint".</span></div>
